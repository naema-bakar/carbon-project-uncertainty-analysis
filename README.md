# carbon-project-uncertainty-analysis
This project reproduces a simplified emissions outcome calculation using public carbon registry data and stress-tests key assumptions to understand uncertainty and delivery risk.

The aim is to demonstrate reproducible, transparent analysis rather than replicate full registry methodologies.

## Why this project
Carbon project outcomes depend heavily on assumptions around baselines, leakage, and buffers.  
This analysis explores how sensitive reported outcomes are to those assumptions and highlights where uncertainty matters most.

## Data
Publicly available documentation from a standard carbon registry project is used.
Inputs are extracted manually into a structured CSV for transparency.

## Method (high level)
- Recreate a simplified emissions calculation
- Apply scenario and sensitivity analysis
- Visualise uncertainty and key drivers
- Save all outputs reproducibly


## Status
🚧 Work in progress — initial data extraction and pipeline setup.
